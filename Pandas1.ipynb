    "In Pandas, both DataFrame and Series are fundamental data structures used for handling data.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame:\n",
    "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It can be thought of as a table, similar to an Excel spreadsheet or a SQL table.\n",
    "Each column in a DataFrame is a Pandas Series.\n",
    "DataFrames are highly versatile and can hold different types of data (numeric, string, boolean, etc.) in its columns.\n",
    "It can be created from various data sources like lists, dictionaries, CSV files, Excel files, SQL databases, etc.\n",
    "Operations can be performed on entire rows and columns of a DataFrame.\n",
    "DataFrame is suitable for handling structured data where observations are organized in rows and attributes or features are organized in columns.\n",
    "Series:\n",
    "A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, etc.).\n",
    "It can be thought of as a single column of data with an associated index.\n",
    "Series objects are the building blocks of DataFrames.\n",
    "Operations are performed element-wise on Series.\n",
    "Series is ideal for handling data where there is only one dimension, like time series data, or a single column from a DataFrame.\n",

    "ages = pd.Series([25, 30, 27], name='Age')\n",

    "Q5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can  you give an example of when you might use one of these functions? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous functions available in Pandas to manipulate data in a DataFrame. Some common functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "head() and tail(): These functions are used to view the first or last few rows of the DataFrame, respectively. They are useful for quickly inspecting the structure and contents of the DataFrame.\n",
    "info() and describe(): info() provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the data types and number of non-null values in each column, while describe() computes summary statistics (like mean, median, min, max, etc.) for numerical columns.\n",
    "loc[] and iloc[]: These are used for accessing a group of rows and columns by label(s) or integer position(s), respectively. They allow for both label-based and integer-based indexing.\n",
    "drop(): This function is used to remove rows or columns from the DataFrame. It can be useful when you want to eliminate irrelevant or redundant data.\n",
    "fillna(): This function is used to fill missing values in the DataFrame with specified values. It can be used to handle missing data effectively.\n",
    "groupby(): This function is used to group data in the DataFrame based on specified criteria. It's particularly useful for performing aggregation operations on grouped data.\n",
    "apply(): This function is used to apply a function along an axis of the DataFrame. It can be used to transform data in a column or row-wise manner.\n",
    "sort_values(): This function is used to sort the DataFrame by the values along one or more columns. It's useful for arranging data in a desired order.\n",
    "pivot_table(): This function is used to create a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame. It's useful for summarizing and aggregating data in a tabular format.\n",
    "merge() and concat(): These functions are used for combining multiple DataFrames either by merging them based on common columns (merge()) or by concatenating them along a particular axis (concat()). They are useful for combining data from different sources.\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Product': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'C'],\n",

    "Q6. Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel? \n",
    "In Pandas, both Series and DataFrame are mutable, while Panel is considered deprecated since version 0.25.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series: A Pandas Series is mutable, meaning you can change the values within it after it has been created.\n",
    "DataFrame: Similarly, a Pandas DataFrame is mutable. You can modify its contents, add or remove columns, and perform various operations to manipulate the data it contains.\n",
    "Panel: Panels were 3D containers of data and were mutable. However, they are deprecated since version 0.25.0 of Pandas and are no longer recommended for use. Instead, you should use multi-index DataFrames or other appropriate data structures for handling multi-dimensional data.\n",
