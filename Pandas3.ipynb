    "\n",
    "In pandas, loc and iloc are both used for accessing data within a DataFrame, but they differ in how they reference the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "loc: This is primarily label-based indexing. It is used to access rows and columns by their labels or boolean array.\n",
    "\n",
    "iloc: This is primarily integer-based indexing. It is used to access rows and columns by their integer position, similar to Python's standard list slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of their differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "loc:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accesses data based on label.\n",
    "Uses the row and column labels to access data.\n",
    "The row labels are typically index labels, and the column labels are column names.\n",
    "Allows slicing using label names.\n",
    "Inclusive of both start and stop labels when using slicing.\n",
    "Raises KeyError if the specified labels are not found.\n",
    "iloc:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accesses data based on integer position.\n",
    "Uses integer positions to access data.\n",
    "The integer positions start from 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean of each column (column_means):\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the .mean() method on the DataFrame calculates the mean for each column.\n",
    "The result is a Series where the index represents the column names and the values represent the mean of each column.\n",
    "Standard deviation of column 'column_2' (std_dev_column_2):\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the .std() method on a specific column, in this case, 'column_2', calculates the standard deviation for that column.\n",
    "The result is a single value representing the standard deviation of 'column_2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Replace the data present in the second row of column, ‘column_2’ by a string variable then find the\n",
    "mean of column, column_2.\n",
    "If you are getting errors in executing it then explain why.\n",
    "[Hint: To replace the data use df1.loc[] and equate this to string data of your choice.]\n",

    "Q6. What do you understand about the windows function in pandas and list the types of windows\n",
    "functions?\n",
    "In pandas, the window functions provide a flexible way to perform rolling or expanding calculations on data within a specified window or range. These functions are particularly useful for time series data analysis and can also be applied to other types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions typically involve calculating some statistic (e.g., mean, sum, standard deviation) over a specified window of data points. The window can be defined based on a fixed number of preceding or following data points, or it can be based on a fixed time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of window functions in pandas include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling Window Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions perform calculations over a fixed-size window of data points.\n",
    "Commonly used rolling window functions include rolling.mean(), rolling.sum(), rolling.std(), etc.\n",
    "Example: Calculating the rolling average of a time series over the past 7 days.\n",
    "Expanding Window Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions perform calculations over an expanding window that grows with the data.\n",
    "The expanding window includes all data points up to the current point.\n",
    "Commonly used expanding window functions include expanding.mean(), expanding.sum(), expanding.std(), etc.\n",
    "Example: Calculating the cumulative sum of a time series over time.\n",
    "Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA):\n",
    "\n",
    "EWMA is a type of rolling window function that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past data points.\n",
    "It gives more weight to recent data points and less weight to older data points.\n",
    "Implemented using the ewm() function in pandas.\n",
    "Example: Calculating the EWMA of a time series to smooth out fluctuations.\n",
    "Window Aggregations:\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions aggregate data over a fixed-size or variable-size window.\n",
    "They allow custom aggregation functions to be applied over a window of data.\n",
    "Implemented using the rolling.apply() or expanding.apply() functions with a custom aggregation function.\n",
    "Example: Calculating the median of a time series over a rolling window.\n",
